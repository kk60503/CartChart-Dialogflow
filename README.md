# CartChart-Dialogflow

Cart Chart is a voice user interface (VUI) chatbot that I created in my Voice Assistants class. \
It was created using Google's Dialogflow ES, Node.js, and the Google Cloud Console.

The basic functionality of Cart Chart is to assist users in finding food carts around 
the Portland, Oregon area. It searches a hard-coded food cart database on basic topics like 
food type or neighborhood/region and then uses the Google Places API to provide user's with
response data such as food cart hours, location, ratings, and reviews.
